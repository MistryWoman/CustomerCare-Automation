# CustomerCare-Automation
This a project that I made for a business plan and innovation concept show. 

It explores the concept of automated call routing for call centers, case in point is about telecom call centers.
The central idea being that by using speech to text analysis , pattern recognition and text mining one can automate call routing to 
appropriate representative i.e prepaid or postpaid agent.

Thus invalidating the need for the traditional digit recorded routing that customers are forced to type in after listening to a menu of options.
